# coma_discrimination_prediction_most_important_features
This repository contains the scripts that have been used for an ongoing study of discrimination of patients in /not in coma, discrimination of different coma etiology and prediction of outcome after two months.
The aim was to find the most discriminative/predictive features among structural and functional MRI preselected indexes.
For this study I have used SVC/SVR, features selection and CV methods.
